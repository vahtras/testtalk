## Shell

* *In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's
services.* 

* *It is named a shell because it is a layer around the operating system
kernel (Wikipedia)*

## Why

GUI vs CLI

* you want the computer to do stuff for you
* you need to communicate with the computer somehow
    * sign language: point-and-click (graphical user interface)
    * words: small set of commands the computer understands (command line * interface, aka terminal aka shell)



- Cryptic

+ Powerful
+ Remote access
+ Combinations of programs


* A collection of well defined programs that does one thing well
* Can be combined in many ways
* Piping command means chaninig output from to input to another


---

## Navigation

* The *file system* organizes data into files and directories (folders)
* Directories are special files that are contains of other files
* Often called a file tree
* The begining of the tree is called the root "/"

<ul>
<li> Directories are branches</li>
<li> Files are leaves</li>
</ul>

???

* Files names often have a dot, the latter part is the extension 
* signifies type of file
* convention not requirement

## Getting help

```
$ help
GNU bash, version 4.4.7(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
These shell commands are defined internally.  Type `help' to see this list.
Type `help name' to find out more about the function `name'.
Use `info bash' to find out more about the shell in general.
Use `man -k' or `info' to find out more about commands not in this list.

A star (*) next to a name means that the command is disabled.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of echo, which usually super‐
       sedes the version described here.  Please refer to your  shell's  docu‐
       mentation for details about the options it supports.

## Looking around

* **prompt** (*noun*) an act of encouraging a hesitating speaker. (Wikipedia)


* **REPL** read-execute-print-loop

???

What do you see
- a dollar sign and a blinking square
- the dollar sign is a prompt asking for input
- the blinking square is a cursor
- try changing the prompt PS1=

The REPL bash
- enter a word
- computer finds a program that matches that word
- runs that program
- prints result
- ask for more

What happens if you type something wrong

Where do we start?
- whatabout `help`
- whatabout hello. command for printing is...`echo`
- terminal shortcuts? ^A ^E ^P ^L

questions we may want to ask
- `whoami`
- where are we?  `pwd` print working directory
    - the first directory after logging is called home directory
    - HOME is an environment variable
    - ~ is an alias for home
    - ~user is an alias for user's home
    - *current working directory* the default director our computer things we
      want to work with when running programs

- what's in here? `ls`
    - long format
        - file type - permissions - owner - size - date (of last modification)
    - hidden files
    - recursive
    - arguments/ defaults
    - what is '.' and '..'?
    - *try invalid argument*

* commands taking arguments/parameters
* commands with options single or double dash
* demonstrate tab completion


---
## Moving around

* *cd* - change directory
* shortcuts: 
	- ~ (home) 
	- . (current directory) 
	- .. (parent directory)
	
    
* relative/absolute path of a file 

Example

```
/home/guest/dir1  # <- current directory
└── file1
/home/guest/dir2
└── file2
```
* You are in dir1 referencing file2
* absolute path: `/home/guest/dir2/file2`
* relative path: `../dir2/file2`



{% if False %}
<div class="col-md-9">
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
<iframe src="https://localhost:4200"></iframe>
</div>
</div>
{% endif %}

???

* cd (without argument)
* cd dir (argument)
A useful command is `cd -` if you swap between two different directories

* relative pathds `cd ../Music`
* absolute paths `cd /home/guest/Music
* what is a path
    * path of a filename
        * generally a sequence of names in the file tree to reach a specific file
        * names are separated by a forward slash
        * absolute path starts from the root
        * relative paths starts from current . (or ..)
    
---

## Working with files and direcories


* `mkdir` create directory
* `rmdir` remove directory
* `nano file` edit/create a file
* `cat` print contents of files
* `rm` remove file


{% if False %}
<div class="col-md-9">
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
<iframe src="https://localhost:4200"></iframe>
</div>
</div>
{% else %}
```
$ mkdir thesis
```
{% endif %}

???
15 min

* create del files  and direcories
* `mkdir thesis`


---

### Special characters

* `>`: redirect (screen) output
	```$ ls > filelist```
* `<`: redirect (terminal) input
    ```$ cat <```
* `|`: piping (passing output to input) `$ cat file | sort`
* `*` wildcard (matches anything) `$ ls *.txt`
* `?` wildcard (matches any single character) `$ ls ?.txt`
* `[]` selection


```
$ ls h*.txt
hello.txt  hi.txt  ho.txt  h.txt  hx.txt
$ ls h?.txt
hi.txt ho.txt hx.txt
$ ls h[io].txt
hi.txt ho.txt

```
---
## Repetition

* execute same code several times with small variations
* loop (for-loop, do-loop)


{% if False %}
<div class="col-md-9">
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
<iframe src="https://localhost:4200"></iframe>
</div>
</div>
{% else %}
from 
```
goostats NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt
goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
goostats NENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt
goostats NENE01751A.txt stats-NENE01751A.txt
goostats NENE01751B.txt stats-NENE01751B.txt
goostats NENE01812A.txt stats-NENE01812A.txt
goostats NENE01843A.txt stats-NENE01843A.txt
...
```
to
```
for txt in NE*[AB].txt
do
goostats $txt stats-$txt
done
```
{% endif %}


???
* explain loop variable/loop value

* exercise: backup a lot of files
* `cp *.dat *.dat.bkp`
* with >2 args, last must be a directory
* avoid spaces in filenames
* `for f in a file; do echo $f; done`

* The example:
    - run goostat on each of the files

* build up the loop in steps

* history commands
* history
* !! !$

* sample loop to file which overwrites/appends
* dry run with echo
* nested loop

---

## Branching: `if` statements

Control characters

* `==`: equality
* `!=`: inequality
* `-r` existing (about files)
* `-x` executable (about files)
* `-d` existing directory 

```
$ if [ $a == "b" ]
$ then
$ echo yes
$ else
$ echo no
$ fi
yes
```

Shortcut control characters

* `&&` continue if ok (exit status zero)
* `||` continue if not ok (exit status non-zero)

---

##  Scripts

* Save bash commands in a file
* make the file executable
* execute file with  `bash file` or `./file`
* put it in a directory in your `PATH`
